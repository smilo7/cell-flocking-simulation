# Flocking Cell Simulation

Simulation experimenting with "boids" like flocking behaviour with various food sources, to see how flocking effects survival.

- Use the slider to change how much cells flock.
- Experiment to see how flocking effects survival rate of the swarm.
- Cells go transparent when they are dying.
